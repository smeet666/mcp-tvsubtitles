# mcp-tvsubtitles

## Tagline

Metascores, audience scores and critic reviews for films, shows and games.

## Description

An MCP server for tvsubtitles.net. Search films, shows and games, read what critics
scored them and what they wrote, and browse rankings when there is no title to
look up.

The two scores are kept apart on purpose. A Metascore runs to 100 and an
audience score to 10, so every score is returned with its own scale, and
nothing invites averaging them. An entry tvsubtitles.net has not scored says so
rather than reporting a zero, which on a scale starting at zero would be a
verdict.

Critic reviews come back with the publication and a link to the original
article, so a quote can be attributed to the person who wrote it.

## Setup Requirements

- `TVS_USER_AGENT` (optional): Identify your own client. The project's own identifier is appended.
- `TVS_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (optional): Minimum gap between requests. Default 1000, and values below 500 are refused.
- `TVS_TIMEOUT_MS` (optional): Per-request deadline. Default 15000.
- `TVS_CACHE_TTL_MS` (optional): In-memory cache lifetime for entries. Default 86400000, with scores cached one hour. Set 0 to turn it off.
- `TVS_LOG_LEVEL` (optional): silent, error, info or debug. Default error, on stderr.

No API key and no account are needed.
